  <p>The family Crocodylidae contains 3 genera and 14 species of crocodile and false gharials that live in marshes, rivers, streams, lakes, and creeks. Different species can be found in parts of North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. They have a V shaped snout. <a href="videoExample.html">Crocodiles</a> are distinguishable from alligators and caimens by their fourth mandibular teeth which are visible when the jaw is closed. No mandibular teeth are visible on an alligator or caimen when the jaw is closed. Crocodiles also tend to be larger and have a more powerful bite. Crocodiles are also more agressive and need warmer temperatures to keep from going dormant. Crocodiles are opportunistic feeders eating a wide variety of prey. They are mostly nocturnal hunters and scavengers living in loose groups.

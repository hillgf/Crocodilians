	<p>The family Gavialidae contains only the gharials. There is currently only one species, the Indian Gharial, and it lives in the deep, fast flowing rivers of Northern India. Due to habitat destruction and humans collecting the eggs for food, it is critically endangered. Gharials have long narrow jaws and are very social. They spend most of their time in
	the water and subsist almost entirely on fish. </p>

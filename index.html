    <h1>Crocodilians are amazing!</h1>
    <p style=""> There are 23 species of crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials, all members of <a href="iframeExample.html">the order Crocodylia</a>. These large reptiles are closely related to birds and dinosaurs. </p><p>Crocodilians are covered in a thick, leathery skin broken into various sizes and shapes of scales that help minimize water loss and function as solar panels transporting heat from the surface to the body core during basking. The massive skulls of these carnivores are filled with air spaces to reduce weight without compromising strength. The eyes placed on top of their head provide 270 degrees of widescreen coverage plus 25 degrees of binocular overlap directly ahead to accurately judge distance. Large pupils give them excellent night vision. Crocodilians have three eyelids, including one that allows them to see underwater. <br><br> They have excellent hearing and can breathe when submerged using raised nostrils. More comfortable in the water, crocodilians can crawl, walk, and even gallop on land. Alligators generate lost teeth and have an amazingly powerful bite! Most species stick around to care for their young after they hatch from eggs. Being cold blooded they can use their energy very efficiently and go very long periods between meals. </p>

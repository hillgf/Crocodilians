   Different species of alligatoridae can be found in parts of central to northern South America, southern and western Central America and Mexico, the southeastern United States, and a small area of eastern China. Alligatoridae have a U shaped snout, stout bodies and powerful tails that are at least as long as their bodies. They have long snouts with lots of teeth. Alligatorids are distinguishable from crocodiles by their mandibular teeth of which none are visible when the jaw is closed. The fourth mandibular teeth in crocodiles are visible even with a closed jaw. Alligators are less agressive than crocodiles and can survive and stay active in colder temperatures. Members of alligatoridae are active all year althrough they retreat to burrows in colder weather. Alligators are also faster than crocodiles. <a href="audioExample.html">Alligators</a> live in groups, form dominance hierarchies and eat a wide variety of prey. </p>
